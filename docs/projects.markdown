    <p class="project-title">Quantum Orbital Visualization (Octave)</p>

    <p class="project-description">
Created a 3D visualization of the time-independent Schrödinger equation solutions for hydrogen-like orbitals using GNU Octave. By plotting probability clouds with scatter3, the project demonstrates how different quantum numbers shape electron orbitals. To build this, I studied calculus and differential equations, gaining a deeper understanding of boundary conditions and how they impact solutions to differential equations. This project enhanced my skills in mathematical modeling, numerical methods, and scientific visualization, while also strengthening my intuition for the physics behind quantum orbitals.</p>
