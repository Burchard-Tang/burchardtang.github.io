    <p class="project-title">Green Infrastructure Map of Toronto (QGIS)</p>
    <p class="project-date">September 2025</p>
    <hr class="solid">
    <p class="project-description">
A map combining four green infrastructure datasets in the Toronto region from Toronto's OpenData portal. Renewable energy installations (2024) and pollination gardens (2025) symbolized with the size of the installation/garden for the marker, green street implementations (2025) (such as bioswales and special drainage into green areas), as well as government maintained electric vehichle chargers (2025) sized by the number of chargers. The map is divided into the Toronto neighbourhoods where the implementations are weighted and summed to produce the intensity of the green areas and show the green development of the area by the government.</p>

    <p class="project-title">Quantum Orbital Visualization (Octave)</p>
    <p class="project-date">August 2025</p>
    <hr class="solid">
    <p class="project-description">
A 3D visualization of the time-independent Schrödinger equation solutions for electron orbitals using GNU Octave. By plotting probability clouds with scatter3, the project demonstrates how different quantum numbers shape electron orbitals. To build this, I studied calculus and differential equations, gaining a deeper understanding of boundary conditions and how they impact solutions to differential equations. This project enhanced my skills in mathematical modeling, numerical methods, and scientific visualization, while also strengthening my intuition for the physics behind quantum orbitals.</p>

    <p class="project-title">Game: Type-Casting (C#)</p>
    <p class="project-date">May - June 2025</p>
    <hr class="solid">
    <p class="project-description">
        <em>Type-Casting</em> is a fantasy-themed bullet hell, top-down survival game designed to challenge the player’s multitasking and precision. 
        Instead of simple controls, players must type spell commands to cast attacks and survive against waves of enemies. 
        The game blends fast-paced action with thoughtful typing mechanics, creating a unique challenge in both skill and focus.
    </p>
    <p class="project-description">
        Built in C# with MonoGame, the project demonstrates strong use of object-oriented programming principles including inheritance and polymorphism. 
        Data structures such as linked lists, sorting and searching algorithms, and recursion were implemented to manage enemy pathing, spellcasting systems, and game state efficiently.

    <p class="project-title">TED Talk–Style Assembly Organizer & Speaker</p>
    <p class="project-date">January 2024</p>
    <hr class="solid">
    <p class="project-description">
        Designed and coordinated a TED Talk–style assembly attended by 200+ junior students. The event featured senior students presenting on motivation and teachers sharing their professional journeys. I contributed both as an organizer and as a speaker, ensuring smooth logistics, clear communication with participants, and impactful delivery to the audience. 
        This engagement strengthened my skills in public speaking and event planning while demonstrating the ability to lead initiatives that inspire and engage a large audience.
