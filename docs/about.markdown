<h2>Engineering Path</h2>
<p>
I’m an incoming Environmental Engineering student with a strong interest in sustainable design, problem-solving, and innovative approaches to protecting our natural resources. My academic and project work reflect a commitment to applying engineering principles to real-world environmental challenges, with the goal of creating practical solutions that support both people and the planet.

    <h2>Beyond Engineering</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of engineering, I enjoy creative hobbies that keep me grounded and inspired. Cooking allows me to experiment and share experiences with others, while crocheting and embroidery give me the chance to create thoughtful, handmade pieces. These hobbies bring balance to my life, encouraging patience, creativity, and attention to detail—qualities I also carry into my engineering work.
